Pickadate.js is a composable date & time state management library. ðŸ•°

> Note: v5 of pickadate.js is in active development. The public API will change before the final stable release.

You can use pickadate.js to create your own UI bindings or custom renderers for date/time pickers.

Or, use one of the bindings baked in:

1. [Plain JavaScript](binding-javascript)
1. [React DOM](binding-react-dom)
1. [React Native](binding-react-native) (TODO)
1. [jQuery](binding-jquery) (TODO)

Which look like this:

<div id="pickadate--datepicker"></div>
